# Problem Statement

Implement a standard VAE with MSE loss for the likelihood on the following datasets (a) CelebA (https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html)
(b) https://github.com/deepmind/dsprites-dataset. Calculate the marginal
likelihood scores for both the case using the procedure outlines in Appendix D in this paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114.pdf). Plot 100
random samples of the generated images in a 10x10 grid for both the
datasets post training
